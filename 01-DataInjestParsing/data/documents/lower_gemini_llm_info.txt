lmm is an abbreviation that stands for **large language model**.

it is a type of **artificial intelligence (ai)** program that is trained on a **massive amount of text data** (hence the word "large"). this extensive training allows the model to:

* **understand** human language (like text you input).
* **generate** human-like text (like answers, articles, summaries, and code).

### 🔑 key characteristics

* **scale and capacity:** llms are characterized by their immense size, often containing billions or even trillions of **parameters**. this size allows them to capture intricate patterns and nuances in language.
* **transformer architecture:** most modern llms are built on a neural network architecture called a **transformer**, which is highly effective at tracking relationships and context across long sequences of text.
* **core function:** at a fundamental level, an llm works by being very good at **predicting the next word** in a sequence, which allows it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

### 💡 common applications

llms power many of the advanced ai tools you hear about today. they are used for:

* **conversational ai/chatbots:** like the one you are interacting with now.
* **content generation:** drafting emails, writing articles, creating marketing copy.
* **summarization and translation:** quickly condensing large documents or translating languages.
* **code generation:** writing or debugging computer code based on natural language instructions.

**examples of llms** include models like openai's gpt series (which powers chatgpt), google's gemini and palm, anthropic's claude, and meta's llama.
