LMM IS AN ABBREVIATION THAT STANDS FOR **LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL**.

IT IS A TYPE OF **ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)** PROGRAM THAT IS TRAINED ON A **MASSIVE AMOUNT OF TEXT DATA** (HENCE THE WORD "LARGE"). THIS EXTENSIVE TRAINING ALLOWS THE MODEL TO:

* **UNDERSTAND** HUMAN LANGUAGE (LIKE TEXT YOU INPUT).
* **GENERATE** HUMAN-LIKE TEXT (LIKE ANSWERS, ARTICLES, SUMMARIES, AND CODE).

### 🔑 KEY CHARACTERISTICS

* **SCALE AND CAPACITY:** LLMS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THEIR IMMENSE SIZE, OFTEN CONTAINING BILLIONS OR EVEN TRILLIONS OF **PARAMETERS**. THIS SIZE ALLOWS THEM TO CAPTURE INTRICATE PATTERNS AND NUANCES IN LANGUAGE.
* **TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE:** MOST MODERN LLMS ARE BUILT ON A NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE CALLED A **TRANSFORMER**, WHICH IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT TRACKING RELATIONSHIPS AND CONTEXT ACROSS LONG SEQUENCES OF TEXT.
* **CORE FUNCTION:** AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL, AN LLM WORKS BY BEING VERY GOOD AT **PREDICTING THE NEXT WORD** IN A SEQUENCE, WHICH ALLOWS IT TO GENERATE COHERENT AND CONTEXTUALLY RELEVANT TEXT.

### 💡 COMMON APPLICATIONS

LLMS POWER MANY OF THE ADVANCED AI TOOLS YOU HEAR ABOUT TODAY. THEY ARE USED FOR:

* **CONVERSATIONAL AI/CHATBOTS:** LIKE THE ONE YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH NOW.
* **CONTENT GENERATION:** DRAFTING EMAILS, WRITING ARTICLES, CREATING MARKETING COPY.
* **SUMMARIZATION AND TRANSLATION:** QUICKLY CONDENSING LARGE DOCUMENTS OR TRANSLATING LANGUAGES.
* **CODE GENERATION:** WRITING OR DEBUGGING COMPUTER CODE BASED ON NATURAL LANGUAGE INSTRUCTIONS.

**EXAMPLES OF LLMS** INCLUDE MODELS LIKE OPENAI'S GPT SERIES (WHICH POWERS CHATGPT), GOOGLE'S GEMINI AND PALM, ANTHROPIC'S CLAUDE, AND META'S LLAMA.
