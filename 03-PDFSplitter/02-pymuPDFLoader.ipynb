Report View (where you design and create visuals), Data View (to inspect, explore, and curate data tables after they are loaded), and Model View (to manage relationships and view the data model structure). 5 How is Power BI different from Tableau? Both are BI tools. Power BI is often favored for its deep integration with the Microsoft ecosystem, user-friendly interface (especially for Excel users), and cost-e\n",

SSBI is an approach that allows end-users (business analysts) to access, model, and analyze data without needing to rely on IT departments, fostering decentralization and faster decision-making. 2. Data Transformation (Power Query & M) Q# Question Answer 9 What is Power Query? Power Query is the data connection and transformation technology (the Extract, Transform, and Load part) in Power BI. It allows you to connect to, combine, and r\n",

It improves performance, especially with large datasets, and enables the use of DirectQuery and Incremental Refresh. Transformations should be done \"as close to the source as possible.\" 13 What is the difference between merging and appending queries? Merging combines two queries based on a common column (like a SQL JOIN), adding c\n",

It's an in-memory data engine that allows you to create relationships between tables and define complex calculations using DAX. 16 What is the Star Schema? A Star Schema is a data modeling structure with a central Fact Table (containing measurable, transactional data) connected to multiple surrounding Dimension Tables (containing descriptive data, such as Product, Customer, or Date). 17 How do\n",

      "top 500 charectors - 19 What are the differences between Import Mode and DirectQuery Mode? Import Mode copies data into Power BI's cache (VertiPaq engine), offering the fastest query performance but requiring data refreshes. DirectQuery Mode queries the source database directly when a report is accessed, ensuring real-time data but resulting in slower query times. 20 What is a Fact Table vs. a Dimension Table?

A Calculated Column is computed and stored for every row in a table. It uses Row Context and is best for row-level\n",

The Data Gateway acts as a bridge, providing a secure connection between on-premises data sources (like SQL Server databases) and cloud services (like Power BI Service) for scheduled data refreshes and DirectQuery connections. 29 Explain Row-Level Security (RLS). RLS is a feature that restricts data access for given users. It's implemented by defining roles and applying DAX filter expressions to tables in Power BI\n",

Advanced/Scenario Questions Q# Question Answer 39 How do you handle a Many-to-Many relationship in Power BI? The best practice is to use a Bridge Table (or Junction Table) to convert the Many-to-Many relationship into two separate One-to-Many relationships.
