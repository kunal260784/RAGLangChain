The M language (or Power Query Formula Language) is the functional, case-sensitive programming language that Power Query uses to record and execute the data transformations applied in the Query Editor. 11 What is Query Folding? Query Folding is the ability of Power Query to translate transformation steps back into a single native query (e.g., SQL) and execute it\n",

      "on the source database. This dramatically improves performance by offloading processing to the source system. 12 Why is Query Folding important? It improves performance, especially with large datasets, and enables the use of DirectQuery and Incremental Refresh. Transformations should be done \"as close to the source as possible.\" 13 What is the difference between merging and appending queries?

Appending stacks two or more queries on top of each other (like a SQL UNION), adding rows to the main table. 14 What is a Custom Column in Power Query?

      "15 What is Power Pivot? Power Pivot is the data modeling component of Power BI. It's an in-memory data engine that allows you to create relationships between tables and define complex calculations using DAX. 16 What is the Star Schema? A Star Schema is a data modeling structure with a central Fact Table (containing measurable, transactional data) connected to multiple surrounding Dimension Tables (containing descriptive data, such as Product, Customer, or Date). 17 How does the Snowflake Schema\n",

      "data, such as Product, Customer, or Date). 17 How does the Snowflake Schema differ from a Star Schema? The Snowflake Schema normalizes the Dimension Tables into sub-dimension tables, reducing data redundancy but increasing the complexity of the model with more joins. The Star Schema is generally preferred for performance in Power BI. 18 Explain Cardinality in Power BI relationships. Cardinality defines the relationship between two columns. The types are One-to-One (1:1), One-to-Many (1:*), and\n",
      "---------------------\n",

      "19 What are the differences between Import Mode and DirectQuery Mode? Import Mode copies data into Power BI's cache (VertiPaq engine), offering the fastest query performance but requiring data refreshes. DirectQuery Mode queries the source database directly when a report is accessed, ensuring real-time data but resulting in slower query times. 20 What is a Fact Table vs. a Dimension Table?

      "as Measures, Calculated Columns, and Calculated Tables. 22 What are the three fundamental concepts of DAX? Syntax (the rules for writing formulas), Functions (predefined formulas for calculations), and Context (the environment in which a formula is evaluated: Row Context and Filter Context). 23 Explain the difference between a Measure and a Calculated Column. A Calculated Column is computed and stored for every row in a table. It uses Row Context and is best for row-level calculations (e.g.,\n",

It uses Filter Context and is best for aggregations (e.g., [Total Sales] = SUM('Sales'[Amount])). 24 What is the CALCULATE function, and why is it important? CALCULATE is the most powerful and essential function in DAX. It evaluates an expression under a modified Filter Context. It allows you to ignore, add, or override filters\n",

The best practice is to use a Bridge Table (or Junction Table) to convert the Many-to-Many relationship into two separate One-to-Many relationships.

      "Bi-directional cross-filtering allows filters to propagate from both sides of a relationship (Fact to Dimension, and Dimension to Fact). It's sometimes necessary for M:M relationships but should be used sparingly as it can lead to ambiguity and negatively impact performance. 41 When should you use a Calculated Column over a Measure? A Calculated Column should be used when the calculation needs to be performed once at the row level (e.g., categorizing a row based on a condition),\n",

      "or when it needs to be used in a slicer or as a row/column header in a visual. 42 How would you troubleshoot a slow report? 1. Check the Data Source query (ensure Query Folding is happening). 2. Review the Data Model (is it a Star Schema?). 3. Identify slow visuals/measures using the Performance Analyzer. 4. Optimize complex DAX functions. 5. Switch to Import Mode if the report is using DirectQuery. 43 What are 'Parameters' in Power Query? Parameters allow you to make a query dynamically\n",
